# Prometheus-Monitoring-and-Alerting-for-Multiple-EC2
Prometheus Monitoring and Alerting for Multiple EC2 Instances in Multiple Accounts with Slack Integration

1. Set up a Prometheus server on one of the EC2 instances. This can be done by
following the instructions in the Prometheus documentation.
2. Set up one or more Prometheus exporters on each of the other EC2 instances
that you want to monitor. An exporter is a piece of software that runs on a
host and exposes metrics in a format that Prometheus can scrape. There are
many exporters available for different types of systems, such as the Node
Exporter for Linux servers and the MySQL Exporter for databases.
3. Configure the Prometheus server to scrape metrics from the exporters. This
can be done by modifying the configuration file for the server and adding a job
configuration for each exporter.
4. Set up an alerting rule in Prometheus to send a notification to a Slack channel
when a server goes down. This can be done by modifying the configuration
file for the server and adding an alerting rule that specifies the condition under
which the alert should be triggered and the Slack webhook to which the alert
should be sent.
5. Test the system to ensure that it is working as expected. This can be done by
simulating a server failure and verifying that the alert is sent to the Slack
channel
